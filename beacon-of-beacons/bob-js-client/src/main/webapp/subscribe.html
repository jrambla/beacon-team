                <h4>Register a new beacon</h4>
                <p>If you know of a beacon which is not integrated in our system yet, please <a href="mailto:beacon@dnastack.com?subject=[BoB] New beacon request&body=Hi, there is a beacon I would like you to add to the Beacon of Beacons. Its URL and API are described below.">send us an email</a> and include the beacon's URL and API details.</p>
                <p>Beacon of Beacons also supports anonymous beacons. If you have multiple projects exposed as beacons and want to hide their identity, we can aggregate their responses under a beacon with a different name. Please specify this in your request.</p>
                <p>If you have administrative control over your beacon, please make sure it supports the following API:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The query is an HTTP GET request of the following format: <code>http://[BEACON-URL]?chrom={chromosome}&pos={position}&allele={allele}&ref={reference}</code>, where <code>{chromosome}</code> is the chromosome ID (one of the 1-22, X, Y, MT), <code>{position}</code> is a 1-based coordinate within a chromosome, <code>{allele}</code> is any string of nucleotides A,C,T,G or D, I for deletion (insertion) and <code>{reference}</code> is the genome ID prefixed with "hg" (e.g. hg38, hg19, hg18). The first three parameters are compulsory, the last one is only required if the beacon supports multiple genomes. The order of the parameters does not matter and their values are case-insensitive. These parameters should be enough to query the beacon, although further options may be recognized as well (e.g. to request a response in a different format).</li>
                    <li>The response is a plaintext string with one of the following values: <code>YES</code> (the variant has been found), <code>NO</code> (the variant has NOT been found) and <code>NULL</code> (an error occured, e.g. the request is not valid).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more information about beacons, please visit the web of the <a href="http://ga4gh.org/#/beacon">Beacon Project</a>.</p>
